# Bitcoin Ticker

The project's purpose was to leverage REST API calls to fetch crypto exchange rates and then display or alter the app's UI components based on the data received. The app also displays various widgets depending on the platform on which it is running.

This project is a part of a series of projects that I created while learning Flutter.

This was a part of the [The Complete 2021 Flutter Development Bootcamp with Dart](https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-bootcamp-with-dart/) by [Dr. Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/user/4b4368a3-b5c8-4529-aa65-2056ec31f37e/).
